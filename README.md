## About me
I am currently working as an Early Stage Researcher (ESR) for the EU-funded Horizon 2020 project [CLEOPATRA](http://cleopatra-project.eu/) along with pursuing my Ph.D. from [Jožef Stefan Institute](https://ijs.si). Prior to this, I hold a M.Tech degree in Mathematics and computing from [Indian Institute of Technology](https://www.iitp.ac.in/) (Patna, India).

## Research

My research work focuses on the analysis and development of deep learning-based solutions for cross-lingual news reporting bias along several dimensions: topic, language, geography, political orientation, source, sentiment, time, attention, and some other contextual features. It would include domains such as news-value determination and computational journalism. It is conducted under the supervision of Professor [Dunja Mladenić](https://ailab.ijs.si/dunja_mladenic/) and [Marko Grobelnik](https://ailab.ijs.si/marko_grobelnik/). 

I am concerned primarily with research in the field of: News Bias, Digital Journalism, Deep Learning, Machine Learning.
