## Exploring Fusion Techniques in Multimodal AI-Based Recruitment: Insights from FairCVdb

The increasing use of decision-making algorithms has led to concerns about transparency and potential
discrimination, especially when impacting specific social groups. Investigating how sensitive elements
and internal biases influence current multimodal algorithms is crucial. We investigate the fairness and
bias implications of multimodal AI-based recruitment systems using the FairCVdb dataset. We evaluate
the effectiveness of early and late fusion techniques in a variety of settings, including unbiased ideal
conditions and biased real-world scenarios with multimodal biases. Our findings suggest that while late
fusion performs well under unbiased conditions, it may exacerbate biases in real-world scenarios. Early
fusion, on the other hand, generally produces more equitable results, especially when modality selection
is carefully considered. Future research could explore alternative fusion strategies and incorporate addi-
tional fairness constraints to improve fairness in algorithmic decision-making.
